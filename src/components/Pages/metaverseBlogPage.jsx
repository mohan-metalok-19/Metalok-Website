Just like a high end video game, the metaverse is a multi dimensional virtual world and you enter that virtual world via your avatar.',

But if you’re still the old school variety who needs time to get used to the idea of shopping with a headset and gloves, well not to worry you probably have a decade to get used to the idea.But while this new retail style in the Metaverse will take time to become mainstream according to experts, and customers can sit back and wait for the future of shopping to come to them, brands have to start getting future ready right now. Many are already making strides in that direction and have already set up shop, so to speak, in the Metaverse with great success. Luxury fashion brands from Gucci to Louis Vuitton to Burberry and Balenciaga as well as huge global brands such as Nike and Adidas are now selling their NFTs aka their virtual digital collections on different Metaverse platforms.',
